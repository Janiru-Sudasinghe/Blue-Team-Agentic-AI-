**A fully autonomous, self-hosted Blue Team lab that ingests live threat intelligence, generates validated YARA-L 2 detection rules using AI, and deploys them directly into Google SecOps - all without human intervention.**

</div>

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project is a **self-hosted, agentic AI-powered security operations lab** built entirely on a **Proxmox VE hypervisor**. It demonstrates a fully automated Blue Team workflow:

1. **Threat Intelligence Ingestion** — MISP continuously pulls live threat feeds from the internet
2. **Agentic AI Analysis** — The *Hermes Agent* (a Python-driven AI agent) receives threat reports from MISP and sends them to a cloud AI (Grok AI / OpenRouter AI) for deep contextual analysis
3. **YARA-L 2 Rule Generation** — The AI synthesizes the threat data into a YARA-L 2 detection rule ready for Google SecOps
4. **Automated Validation Loop** — The rule is submitted to Google SecOps for syntax and logic validation; if errors are found, the agent autonomously re-submits back to AI for correction until the rule is clean
5. **Automated Deployment** — Once validated, the rule is deployed live into the Google SecOps environment via API
6. **Log Correlation** — Windows system logs from the Host PC are collected via BindPlane and forwarded as normalized logs to Google SecOps SIEM for correlation against deployed rules

> **This entire pipeline runs with zero manual intervention.** From a new threat indicator appearing in MISP to a deployed detection rule in SecOps — Hermes handles it all.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Step-by-Step Pipeline

```
[1] MISP pulls threat intel from public/private feeds (OSINT, CIRCL, etc.)
        │
        ▼
[2] MISP generates a Threat Intel Report (IOCs, TTPs, malware hashes, IPs)
        │
        ▼
[3] Hermes Agent (hermes.py) fetches the report from MISP via REST API
        │
        ▼
[4] Hermes sends the enriched threat context to Grok AI / OpenRouter AI
        │
        ▼
[5] AI performs deep analysis and generates a YARA-L 2 detection rule
        │
        ▼
[6] Hermes submits the rule to Google SecOps Validation API
        │
        ├── ✅ Valid Rule ──► Deploy to SecOps via API  ──► [DONE]
        │
        └── ❌ Syntax/Logic Error ──► Re-send to AI with error feedback
                                          └──► Loop back to [5]
```

### Log Collection (Parallel Pipeline)

```
Host PC (Windows)
    └── Windows Event Logs / Sysmon
            └── BindPlane Agent (Linux VM)
                    └── Normalized Logs ──► Google SecOps SIEM
                                              └── Correlated against
                                                  deployed YARA-L 2 rules
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Hypervisor** | Proxmox VE 8.x | Hosts all VMs in isolated lab |
| **Threat Intel Platform** | MISP (Ubuntu VM) | Live threat feed aggregation |
| **AI Agent** | Python 3.10+ (`hermes.py`) | Agentic orchestration core |
| **AI Analysis** | Grok AI / OpenRouter AI | YARA-L 2 rule generation & validation |
| **SIEM/SOAR** | Google SecOps (Chronicle) | Rule deployment & log correlation |

---

## 🖥️ Lab Environment

All components run as **isolated Virtual Machines** inside a dedicated **Proxmox VE server** in a physical lab environment.

| VM Name | OS | Role | Resources (Recommended) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `misp-vm` | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS | MISP Threat Intelligence | 4 vCPU / 8 GB RAM / 100 GB |
| `hermes-vm` | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS | Hermes Agentic AI Agent | 2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM / 50 GB |
| `bindplane-vm` | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS | BindPlane Log Aggregator | 2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM / 50 GB |
| Host PC | Windows 10/11 | Log Source (Sysmon) | Physical Host |

> **Network:** All VMs communicate over an internal Proxmox bridge (`vmbr0`). Outbound internet access is allowed for MISP feeds and cloud AI APIs.

```powershell
# On the Windows Host PC (run as Administrator)
sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i infrastructure\windows\sysmon-config.xml
```

---

## 🤖 Hermes Agent — Core Script

`hermes.py` is the **brain of the entire pipeline**. It orchestrates all components autonomously:

```python
# Simplified flow of hermes.py

while True:
    # 1. Poll MISP for new threat events
    threat_reports = misp_client.get_new_events()

    for report in threat_reports:
        # 2. Enrich and send to AI for YARA-L 2 rule generation
        yara_rule = ai_client.generate_yara_rule(report)

        # 3. Validate rule — retry loop with AI correction
        max_retries = 5
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            validation = secops_client.validate_rule(yara_rule)

            if validation.is_valid:
                # 4. Deploy the rule to Google SecOps
                secops_client.deploy_rule(yara_rule)
                logger.info(f"Rule deployed successfully: {yara_rule.name}")
                break
            else:
                # 5. Send error feedback back to AI for correction
                yara_rule = ai_client.fix_rule(yara_rule, validation.errors)

    time.sleep(config.POLL_INTERVAL)
```

---

## 🔄 AI Rule Generation Pipeline

The AI prompt to Grok / OpenRouter is carefully engineered to produce valid YARA-L 2 rules:

```
System Prompt:
  You are an expert Google SecOps detection engineer.
  Given a MISP threat intelligence report, generate a syntactically correct
  YARA-L 2 rule for Google SecOps Chronicle SIEM. The rule must:
    - Use proper YARA-L 2 syntax
    - Target the relevant UDM (Unified Data Model) fields
    - Include meaningful metadata (author, severity, reference)
    - Be optimized for performance
  Return ONLY the rule. No explanation. No markdown fences.

User Prompt:
  Threat Report: {misp_event_json}
```

If validation fails, the correction prompt includes the exact error:

```
The following YARA-L 2 rule has a validation error:
  Rule: {rule_text}
  Error: {validation_error_message}

Fix the rule and return only the corrected version.
```

Threat Event: OSINT - Shifting Tactics: Tracking changes in years-long espionage campaign against Tibetans
Indicators of Compromise:
  - [link]  https://citizenlab.org/2016/03/shifting-tactics/
  - [comment]  This report describes the latest iteration in a long-running espionage campaign against the Tibetan community.  We detail how the attackers continuously adapt their campaigns to their targets, shifting tactics from document-based malware to conventional phishing that draws on â€œinsideâ€ knowledge of community activities. This adaptation appears to track changes in security behaviors within the Tibetan community, which has been promoting a move from sharing attachments via e-mail to using cloud-based file sharing alternatives such as Google Drive.

We connect the attack groups infrastructure and techniques to a group previously identified by Palo Alto Networks, which they named Scarlet Mimic. We provide further context on Scarlet Mimicâ€™s targeting and tactics, and the intended victims of their attack campaigns.  In addition, while Scarlet Mimic may be conducting malware attacks using other infrastructure, we analyze how the attackers re-purposed a cluster of their malware Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to mount the recent phishing campaign.

This move is only the latest development in the ongoing cat and mouse game between attack groups like Scarlet Mimic and the Tibetan community. The speed and ease with which attackers continue to adapt highlights the challenges faced by Tibetans who are trying to remain safe online.
